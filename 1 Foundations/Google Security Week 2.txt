Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

Viruses: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data, software, and hardware.
 A virus attaches itself to programs or documents, on a computer. It then spreads and infects one or more computers in a network.
	
Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 

Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices.
 This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 

Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 

Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 

Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate.
 For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 

Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 

Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  

Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.

Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently.
	Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.
	
A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed.
 Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain.
 
A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 
	Birthday
	Collision
	Downgrade
	Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.
	
A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data.
 Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  
	Brute force
	Rainbow table
		Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

Threat Actors
Advanced persistent threats
	Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization.
	APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time.
	 Their intentions and motivations can include:
	Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources
	Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents
	
Insider threats
	Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 
	Sabotage
	Corruption
	Espionage
	Unauthorized data access or leaks
	
Hacktivists
	Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 
	Demonstrations
	Propaganda
	Social change campaigns
	Fame
