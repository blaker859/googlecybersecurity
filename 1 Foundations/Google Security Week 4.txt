			Chain of custody is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle.
		 protecting and preserving evidence playbook.
			Protecting and preserving evidence is the process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence.
			As a security analyst, understanding what fragile and volatile digital evidence is, along with why there is a procedure, is critical.
			you will consult the order of volatility, which is a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last.
			It prioritizes volatile data, which is data that may be lost if the device in question powers off, regardless of the reason.
			While conducting an investigation, improper management of digital evidence can compromise and alter that evidence.
			When evidence is improperly managed during an investigation, it can no longer be used.

Core cybersecurity tools and knowledge
	An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions.
		The system scans and analyzes network packets, which carry small amounts of data through a network.
		The small amount of data makes the detection process easier for an IDS to identify potential threats to sensitive data.
		Other occurrences an IDS might detect can include theft and unauthorized access.
	Cryptographic encoding means converting plaintext into secure ciphertext.
		Plaintext is unencrypted information and secure ciphertext is the result of encryption.
