		section of code that can be reused in code
		
		built in functions and user created functions
		
	Create a basic user defined function
		def 
			creates a function

	Modules and Libraries
	
		Library
			collection of modules
		
		Modules
			python file with additional functions
			
	Python Standard Library 
	
		extensive code packaged with python
			re
				searching for patterns
			csv
				work efficiently with csv files
			glob
			os
				both for command line
			time
			datetime
			numpy
			statistics
				calculating statistics related to numeric data
				
			ex:
			
import statistics
monthly_failed_attempts = [20, 17, 178, 33, 15, 21, 19, 29, 32, 15, 25, 19]
mean_failed_attempts = statistics.mean(monthly_failed_attempts)
print("mean:", mean_failed_attempts)
	
	or 
	
from statistics import mean, median
monthly_failed_attempts = [20, 17, 178, 33, 15, 21, 19, 29, 32, 15, 25, 19]
mean_failed_attempts = statistics.mean(monthly_failed_attempts)
print("mean:", mean_failed_attempts)
