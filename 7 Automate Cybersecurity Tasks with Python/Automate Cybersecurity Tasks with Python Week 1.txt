Introduction to Python programming in Cybersecurity

	Python and Cybersecurity
		Resembles human language
		Less code
		Easy to read
		Standard guidelines
		Online Support
		Built-in code
		
	Automation:
		Log analysis
		Malware analysis
		Access control list management
		Intrusion detection
		Compliance checks
		Network scanning
		

Core Python Components
	Integer
		no decimal point
	
	Boolean
		true or false
		
	List data
		sequential form of data
		
	float
		decimal places
	
	Dictionary
		Dictionary data is data that consists of one or more key-value pairs. Each key is mapped to a value. A colon (:) is placed between the key and value.
		{1: "East", 2: "West"}
		
	Set
		In Python, set data is data that consists of an unordered collection of unique values. This means no two values in a set can be the same. 
		
Variables
	Container that stores data
	
	assignment:
		device_id = "h32rb17"
		
	type()
		returns data type of input
		

Conditional and Iterative Statements
	if
		starts conditional statement
			called the header
		
	should be indented at least one space
	
	Operators
		<,>,>=,<=,==,!=
	
	else
		evaluates when previous are false
		
	elif statements
		if status == 200:

			print("OK")

		elif status == 400:
			
			print("Bad Request")
			
	For Loops
		for i in [1,2,3,4]:
			print(i)
			
		range(0,10)
			sets a sequence from 1-9
			if no start point it starts from 0
			
	While loops
		repeats output until true
		while time <=10:
		
	break
		When you want to exit a for or while loop based on a particular condition in an if statement being True
		, you can write a conditional statement in the body of the loop and write the keyword break in the body of the conditional.
		
	continue
		When you want to skip an iteration based on a certain condition in an if statement being True
		, you can add the keyword continue in the body of a conditional statement within the loop.
