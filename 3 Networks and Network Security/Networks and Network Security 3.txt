Networks and Network Security 3

Network Instrusion Tactics
	
	Common Network Instrusion attacks
		malware
		spoofing
		packet sniffing
		packet flooding
	
	Attacks can harm an organization by
		leaking valuable or confidential information
		damaging an organizations reputation
		impacting customer retention
		costing money and time
	
	Network interception attacks
		intecepting traffic and stealing valuable information of interfering with transmission in some way
		Capturing an inspecting data in transit is known as packet sniffing
		Malicious actors can also intercept traffic and alter it
			inserting malicious code
			altering the message
			interrupting network operations
		on path attacks
		replay attacks
		
	Backdoor attacks
		backdoors are intended to help programmers conduct troublshooting or admin tasks, but they can also be installed by hackers to ensure persistent access
		once inside they can:
			install malware
			perform denioal of service attacks
				target a network or server and flood it with traffic
			steal private info
			change security settings leaving the system vulnerable to other attacks
	
	DOS
		disrupt normal business processes by overloading a network
	DDOS
		using multiple devices and servers in multiple locations to flood traffic
	
	Network Level
		SYN flood attack (synchronizes)
		simulates a TCP connection and floods a server with SYN packets
	
	SYN (synchronize request)
	SYN/ACK (Recieves request)
		leaves port open
	ACK (final packet)
	handshake is established
	
	ICMP (internet control message protocol)
		internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network
		request for a status update from a device
	
	ICMP Flood
		DOS attack repeatedly sending ICMP packets to the server
		
	Ping of death
		pings a system by sending a ICMP packet that is bigger than 64kb
		
	tcpdump logs
		network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer)
			SolarWinds Netflow Traffic Analyzer
			ManageEngine OpManager
			Azure Network Watcher
			Wireshark
			tcpdump
		tcpdump is a command-line network protocol analyzer
			lightweight
			opensource libpcap library
			preinstalled on many linux distros
		provides a brief packet analysis and converts key information about network traffic into formats easily read by huans
		prints info about each packet directly into your terminal
		displays the source IP address, destination IP addresses, and port numbers being used in the communications
	interpretting output
		prints the output of the command as the sniffed packets in the command line and optionally to a log file
		the output of a packet capture contains many pieces of important information about the network traffic
		Packet capture:
			Timestamp
			source IP
			source port
			Destination IP
			Destination Port
		Uses:
			establish a baseline for network traffic patterns and network utilization metrics
			detect identify malicious traffic
			create customized alerts to send the right notifications when network issues or security threats arise
			locate unautorized instant messaging, traffic, or wireless access points
		Malicious uses:
			look at info such as usernames, passwords
			
	Malicious Packet Sniffing
		Header
			mac address
			ip address
		Body
			data
		Footer
		
	Passive packet sniffing
		read in transit
		
	Active Packet sniffing
		packets manipulated in transit
		changing port path
		changing information
		
	Preventing Malicious Packet Sniffing
		VPNs to encrypt
		wont be able to decode packets
		utilize HTTPS to encrypt data
		avoid unprotected wifi
		
	IP spoofing
		network attack performed when an attacker changes the source IP of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system and gain access to a network
		On-Path attack
			places themselves in the middle of an authorized connection and intercepts or alters the data in transit
		Replay Attack
			intercepts a data packet in transit and delays it or repeats it at a different time
			impersonate
		Smurf Attack
			sniffs an authorized user's IP address and floods it with packets
			fix: deny all incoming traffic coming from the same ip
			
	NIC (network interface card)
		connects the device to a network
		reads transmission data, if it contains the device's MAC address, it accepts the packet and sends it to the device to process the information based on the protocol
		Promiscuous mode = accepts all traffic on the network even packets not addressed to the NICs device
