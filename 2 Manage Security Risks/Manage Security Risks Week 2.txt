Frameworks and Controls Week 2

Frameworks
		guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy
Controls
		Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks
			encryption
				encoding format
			authentication
				the process of verifying who someone or something is
			authorization
				the concept of granting access to specific resources within a system
				person has permission to look at a resource
				
		Office of the Director of National
			Intelligence, the CTF was developed by the U.S. government to provide
				“a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.”
				
		The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets,
			International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001
				such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties.
				 Although the ISO/IEC 27001 framework does not require the use of specific controls
					it does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture. 
Design Principles
		CIA Triad
			A model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies
				Confidentiality
					only authorized users can access specific resources and data
						need to know basis
				Integrity
					the data is correct, authentic, and reliable
				Availability
					data is accessible to those wo are authorized to access it
		CSF NIST
			a coluntary framework that consists of standards, guidlines and bestpractices to handle cybersercurity risks					
					SP 800.53
						protections for government assets
				Identify
					the management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organizations people and assets
				Protect
					The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats
				Detect
					Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections
				Respond
					Makins sure that the process procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process
				Recover
					The process of returning affected systems back to normal operation
		Open Web Applications Security Project (OWASP)
			minimize attack surface area
				all potential vulnerabilities
				attack vectors
					phishing emails
					weak passwords
				disable certain functions
			principle of least privilege
				have the least amount of privilege to do their everyday tasks
			defense in depth
				organization should have multiple security controls
					mfa
					firewalls
					ids
					permission settings
			separation of duties
				noone should be given so many privelges that they can missuse the system
			keep security simple
				Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult. 
			fix security issues correctly
				identify root cause quickly
				correct vulnerabilities and conduct tests to make sure of success
	Establish secure defaults
		This principle means that the optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users;
		it should take extra work to make the application insecure. 
	Fail securely
		Fail securely means that when a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option.
		For example, when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones, rather than start accepting everything.
	Don’t trust services
	Avoid security by obscurity
		The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. Use multiple factors of safety
Audits
		a review of an organizaitons security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations
		external and internal audits
			internal audits
				identify organizaitonal risk
				assess controls
				correct compliance issues
		Common Elements of internal Audits
			Establishing the scope and goals
				specific criteria of an internal security audit
				goals are an outline of the security objectives
			conducting a risk assessment
				identifying potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities
			completing a controls assessment
				closely assessing assets and controls
					control categories
						administrative controls
						technical controls
							hardware and software controls
						physical controls
							cctv
							locks
			assessing compliance
				are we aligning with regulatory compliance
			communicating results to stakeholders
				once complete results and recommendations need to be communcated
				notes how quickly risks need to be addressed
				identifies compliance regulations
				recommendations on how to fix
