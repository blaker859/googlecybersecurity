Linux Architecture
	Components
		user
			interacting with computer
		
		applications
			program for specific tasks

		shell
			command line interpretor
		
		filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS)
			component of the linux os that organizes data
		
		kernel
			manages processes and memory
			uses drivers to execute tasks
		
		hardware
			physical components of computer
	
	Applications
		package manager
			tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages/applications
		package
			piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application
	
	Shell
		command line interpretor
		give commands to the kernel and receive responses from it
		
	Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
		specifies location where data is stored on the os
			Directory
				folders that contain files or other directories.
				The FHS defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage is organized so the OS knows where to find specific data
	
	Kernel
		component of the Linux OS that manages processes and memory
		communicates with the applications to route commands.
		the linux kernel is unique to the Linux OS and is critical for allocating resources in the system.
		The kernel controls all major functions of the hardware which can help get tasks expedited more efficiently
	
	Hardware
		phyisical components of a computer
	
	Peripheral devices
		hardware comopnents that are attached and controlled by the computer system
		Can be added or removed freely: 
			monitors
			printers
			keyboard
			mouse
	
	Internal Hardware
		CPU
			general computing tasks
		RAM
			short term memory
			data needed for program is stored in RAM and then when closed it is deleted
		hard drive
			is a hardware comonent used for long term memory
			
Linux Distributions
	Red Hat Enterprise Linux (CentOS)
	Slackware (SUSE)
	Debian (Ubuntu and KALI LINUX)
	
	Kali Linux
		Created with Pen Testing and Digital Forensics in mind
		Should be used in a virtual machine
		
		Metasploit
			find vulnerabilites and exploit them on machines
			
		Burp Suite
			test for weaknesses in web apps
			
		John the Ripper
			guess passwords
			
		Digital Forensics
			collecting and analyzing data to determine what has happened after an attack
			
			tcpdump
				capture network traffic
			wireshark
				gui - analyze live and captured network traffic
			autopsy
				harddrives and smart phones
		
	Red Hat Enterprise Linux
		subscription based distro built for enterprise use
		offers dedicated support team for customers to call about issues
		
	CentOS
		os closely related to Red Hat
		Uses source code published by red hat to provide a similar platform
		does not offer the same support, supported by community
		
	Ubuntu
		widely used in security and other industries
		Debian Derived common application by default
		Widely used in Cloud Computing
		
	Parrot
		open source distribution that is commonly used for security similar to Kali Linux
		Debian based
		
Package Managers
	Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) can be used for Linux distributions derived from Red Hat
	package managers such as dpkg can be used for Linux distributions derived from Debian
	Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) has files which use the .rpm file extension
	Debian-derived Linux distributions, such as dpkg, have files which use the .deb file extension
	
Package Management Tools
	Two notable tools are the Advanced Package Tool (APT) and Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM).
	APT is a tool used with Debian-derived distributions. It is run from the command-line interface to manage, search, and install packages.
	YUM is a tool used with Red Hat-derived distributions. It is run from the command-line interface to manage, search, and install packages. YUM works with .rpm files.
	
Helpful navigation tips and keyboard shortcuts

CTRL + C: Terminates a command that is currently running; from the instructions portion of Qwiklabs, you can use CTRL + C to copy, but within the terminal, it will only terminate a command and if one isn't running, it will display ^C at the prompt
CTRL + V: Pastes text
clear: Clears the terminal screen; this can also be done by entering CTRL + L
CTRL + A: Sets your cursor at the beginning of a command
CTRL + E: Sets your cursor at the end of a command
Left arrow key: Moves left within a command
Right arrow key: Moves right within a command
Up arrow key: Provides the last command you entered into the command line; can be entered multiple times to go through multiple commands from the command history
Down arrow key: Provides the next command in the command history; must be after using the up arrow key
Tab key: Provides available suggestions for completing your text 

Introduction to the Shell
	command line interpretor
	
	Bourne-Again Shell (bash)
	C Shell (csh)
	Korn Shell (KSH)
	Enhanced C shell (tcsh)
	Z shell (zsh)
	
Input and Output in the Shell
	Standard input
		information received by the OS via the CLI
		echo
			outputs specified string of text
		String data
			ordered sequence of characters
	
	Generate output in the shell the echo command
	Perform basic calculations the expr command
	Clear the shell window the clear command
