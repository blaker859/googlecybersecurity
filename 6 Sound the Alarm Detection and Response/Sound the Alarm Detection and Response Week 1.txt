		Identify
		Protect
		Detect
		Respond
		Recover
		
	5Ws:
		Who triggered the incident
		What happened
		When the incident took place
		Where the incident took Place
		Why the incedent occured
		
	Incident Handlers Journal
		form of documentation used for a response
		
Incedent Response Operations
		
	Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT)
		a specialized group of security professionals that are trained in incident management and response
			
			Security Analyst
			Technical Lead (ops lead)
			Incident coordinator (HRT) (SIRT)
			
			
Roles and Resopnse
		Preparation
		Detection and Analysis
		Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
		Post-incident activity
	
	Command, control, and communication
		Command
			refers to having the appropriate leadership and direction to oversee the response.
		Control 
			refers to the ability to manage technical aspects during incident response, like coordinating resources and assigning tasks.
		Communication 
			refers to the ability to keep stakeholders informed.
			
	Security operations center
		organizational unit dedicated to monitoring networks, systems, and devices for security threats or attacks
		A SOC is involved in various types of blue team activities, such as network monitoring, analysis, and response to incidents. 
		
	Tier 1 SOC analyst
		Monitoring, reviewing, and prioritizing alerts based on criticality or severity
		Creating and closing alerts using ticketing systems
		Escalating alert tickets to Tier 2 or Tier 3
		
	Tier 2 SOC analyst
		Receiving escalated tickets from L1 and conducting deeper investigations
		Configuring and refining security tools
		Reporting to the SOC Lead
		
	Tier 3 SOC lead
		Managing the operations of their team
		Exploring methods of detection by performing advanced detection techniques, such as malware and forensics analysis
		Reporting to the SOC manager
		
	SOC manager
		Hiring, training, and evaluating the SOC team members
		Creating performance metrics and managing the performance of the SOC team
		Developing reports related to incidents, compliance, and auditing
		Communicating findings to stakeholders such as executive management   
		
	SOCs can also contain other specialized roles such as: 
		Forensic investigators: Forensic investigators are commonly L2s and L3s who collect, preserve, and analyze digital evidence related to security incidents to determine what happened.
		Threat hunters: Threat hunters are typically L3s who work to detect, analyze, and defend against new and advanced cybersecurity threats using threat intelligence.

		Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
			is an application that monitors an endpoint for malicious activity.
			EDR tools are installed on endpoints. 
				Remember that an endpoint is any device connected on a network. Examples include end-user devices, like computers, phones, tablets, and more.

		SOAR tools (Security orchestration, automation, and response)
			a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events
			
			Automates analysis and response to security alerts
			tracks cases
